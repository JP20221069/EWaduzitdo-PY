# EWaduzitdo-PY
EWaduzitdo is an esoteric programming language created as a collaboration between Serbian programmer Petar Jovanović and American Musician & Programmer Tyler Zahnke in May 2024. 
EWaduzitdo is an extension of the classic 1978 esolang Waduzitdo, and its name is an abbreviation of Extended Waduzitdo. It was designed as a superset of Waduzitdo, hence some of Tyler's other name suggestions, Waduzitdo++, WaduzitdoNow, and NowWaduzitdo, the latter name hinting at the fact that it could be used in the same way Waduzitdo was used in 1978, for teaching people who never programmed before how a programming language works and what it does. As a superset, Waduzitdo programs should also work in EWaduzitdo, just like C programs being run through C++. Though there is currently no documentation for EWaduzitdo, the Python source code of the interpreter is essentially an extended version of Jovanović's classic Waduzitdo interpreter in Python, released earlier the same day, with support for new features such as numbered variables, string matching instead of just individual character matching, and even basic arithmetic functions.
